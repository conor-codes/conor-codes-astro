My personal developer portfolio — built with **Astro**, **Tailwind CSS**, and deployed on **Vercel**.

This site showcases my work, experience, and projects as a **.NET / MAUI Developer**.  
It’s designed to be clean, minimal, and fast — with a focus on clarity, craft, and a touch of personality.

## 🚀 Overview

I wanted a portfolio that reflects how I build software: simple, purposeful, and performant.  
The site highlights selected projects, a short “About Me” section, and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn.

Astro made that process seamless and enjoyable.
